Data is an integral part of many JupyterLab workflows, but a native data editing tool is non-existent. The JupyterLab Tabular Data Editor provides an interface to edit your data files side-by-side with Jupyter notebooks. 

With this extension, you can create csv files from scratch, navigate through millions of cells smoothly, and manage your data all within JupyterLab.

This extension streamlines the editing process with a refined suite of commands that help you prepare your data for further work in machine learning, scientific computing, or other data-driven tasks.
